# 🏭 Indian Air Quality Data Analysis  

A data science project focused on analyzing India's air quality data, building predictive models for Air Quality Index (AQI), and visualizing trends using Tableau dashboards.  

---

## 📊 Project Overview  
Air pollution is a major concern in India, with millions affected every year. This project aims to:  
- Clean and preprocess large-scale air quality datasets (430k+ records).  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify pollution patterns.  
- Build machine learning models to forecast AQI levels with high accuracy.  
- Visualize results through interactive Tableau dashboards for better interpretation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Visualization:** Tableau (Heatmaps, Time-Series, Pollutant Trends)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in) – Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data  
- **Size:** 430,000+ rows | 13 features  
- **Features Include:** SO₂, NO₂, RSPM, SPM, PM2.5, Location, State, Date, Agency, etc.

## 🔑 Key Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies  
   - Standardized column formats for consistency  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Trend analysis for pollutants  
   - Correlation heatmaps and seasonal variations  

3. **Model Building:**  
   - Trained Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models  
   - Achieved **99.97% accuracy** with Random Forest  

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Created Tableau dashboards with AQI heatmaps and time-series views

## 📈 Results  
- **Random Forest Classifier achieved 99.97% accuracy**  
- Identified top high-risk regions based on AQI trends  
- Delivered clear visual insights for further research and policy-making  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Integrate real-time AQI data streams  
- Deploy model as an API for live forecasting  
- Add predictive alerts for critical regions
